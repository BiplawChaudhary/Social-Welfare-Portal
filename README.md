# Social Welfare Portal
This project was developed for TechTrix Hackathon-2023 by Team Moon-Knights.
The theme of Hackathon was "E-Governance".

## Description of Project
The <b>"Social Welfare Portal"</b> we created is for the NGOs to digitalize the grant request and approval process. 

### What was this portal built for?
NGOs needs aid from governmanet time to time. This portal digitalizes this process. The government can allocate budget for welfare in certain sectors. 
By looking at the buget, NGOs can apply for the aid, if the sector they are planning to aid is listed in the governments buget section. 
For this NGOs prepare a proposal and apply for grant with that proposal. 
This site is managed by the body of government which manages the grants for NGOs.
